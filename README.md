# DETECTION AND SCARING OF SELECTIVE BIRDS USING IOT DEVICES IN AGRICULTURE

## üåü **Project Overview**  
This project aims to protect crops by detecting parrots and sparrows using AI and scaring them away with a buzzer, integrated through an IoT system. It sends real-time alerts to farmers via the **Blynk app**, ensuring effective crop protection.

---

## üöÄ **Objectives**  
- Detect parrots and sparrows using a CNN model.  
- Activate a buzzer via **ESP32** microcontroller upon bird detection.  
- Send real-time notifications through the **Blynk app**.  
- Improve crop protection and minimize damage caused by birds.

## üîß **Methodology**  
1. **Data Collection**: Gather images of birds for training the AI model.  
2. **AI Model**: Use CNN for accurate bird detection.  
3. **IoT Integration**: Connect ESP32 to control the buzzer.  
4. **Notification System**: Send alerts via **Blynk app**.  
5. **Field Testing**: Validate the system‚Äôs effectiveness in real conditions.
